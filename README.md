# migraineinator

Goal: collect environmental and meteorological data around the dates and times a migraine happens.  Collected and stored local.

This is a fun experiment for me, as I'm using GHCP to write the literal code while I spend the time thinking and trying to understand.  Also I'm still learning Rust.
